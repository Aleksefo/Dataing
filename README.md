# Dataing
Dating web app, uses Bisnode's API to work with Finnish population data
## Summary
Dating app made by our team during "Play around with Finns" hackathon. We were provided with Bisnode's database of Finnish Population Data(age, gender, education, property etc.) and had to come with idea of how we can utilize the data. We decided to build Dating app, which allows you to match with your perfect partner, based on survey you pass. We used Meteor as app's framework since it was an efficient tool 
to use and learn during 3 days of the hackathon.

Unfortunately app doesn't have access to Bisnode's API anymore, but here's the demonstration video:
